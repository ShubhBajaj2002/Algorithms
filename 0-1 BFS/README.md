# Calculating level of each node when the only weights possible are 0 and 1
- Input format :
  - First line contains 2 numbers denoting the number of vertices and edges respectively
  - The next lines contains 3 integers, 2 denoting the nodes at the ends and the other denoting weight (either 0 or 1) of the edge
  - The last line contains a number denoting the source node from where the bfs has to be started
- Output :
  - Each line will contain two numbers, the first one denoting the vertex and next one denoting its level w.r.t the source node
- NOTE : All the vertices are to be numbered uniquely within the range [1, N] , where N denotes the number of vertices
