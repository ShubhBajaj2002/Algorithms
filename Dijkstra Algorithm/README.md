# Using Dijkstra Algorithm to find the minimum distances of all nodes from the given node
- Input format :
  - First line contains 2 integers denoting the number of vertices and edges respectively
  - The next lines contains 3 integers, 2 corresponding to the vertices at the ends of each edge and the other denoting its weight
  - The last line contains a number denoting the source node from where the distances are to be calculated
- Output :
  - Each line will contain two numbers, the first one denoting the vertex and next one denoting its distance w.r.t the given node
- NOTE : All the vertices are to be numbered uniquely within the range [1, N] , where N denotes the number of vertices
