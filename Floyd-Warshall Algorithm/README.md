# Using Floyd-Warshall Algorithm to find the minimum distances between all nodes in a given Graph
- Input format :
  - First line contains 2 integers denoting the number of vertices and edges respectively
  - The next lines contains 3 integers, 2 corresponding to the vertices at the ends of each edge and the other denoting its weight
- Output :
  - Minimum distances between nodes in a matrix format
- NOTE : All the vertices are to be numbered uniquely within the range [1, N] , where N denotes the number of vertices
