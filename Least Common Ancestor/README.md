# Finding the Least Common Ancestor of two given nodes
- Input Format :
   - First line contains 2 numbers denoting the number of vertices and edges respectively
   - The next lines contains 2 numbers each denoting the vertices at the ends of each edge
   - The next line contains a number denoting the root of the tree
   - The last line contains 2 numbers denoting 2 nodes whose LCA has to be calculated
- Output  :
   - The least common ancestor of the given nodes
- NOTE : All the vertices are to be numbered uniquely within the range [1, N] , where N denotes the number of vertices
